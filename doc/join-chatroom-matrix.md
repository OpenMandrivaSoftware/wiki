# Newcomer guide: join OpenMandriva chat room with Matrix

Here is a quick guide to create an account in Matrix. If you are looking for general guide please go [here](/doc/chat-faq).
One of the main advantage of Matrix is to keep conversations logs even when you’re not connected.

You can create an account with any [matrix client](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html), but for simplicity we’ll use in this guide the web version of Riot client. Riot is the most commonly used client, is multi-language, easy to use and very complete client, available on [almost all devices](https://about.riot.im/) (Android, iOS, desktop, web…).

If you already have a Matrix account, you can jump to [paragraph](/doc/join-chatroom-matrix#the-interesting-part-joining-openmandriva-rooms)


## Registration

### Register an account on the [Riot web page](https://riot.im/app/)

### If you just created a new account, On the top left, you see an invitation from a bot called «System Alerts». Click on it and accept the invitation
