# Donation and Sponsorship

We at OpenMandriva enjoy working to bring to you a first-class and well-maintained Linux distribution.

We work passionately as part of and for a thriving open source community.
As we are not a commercial organization, we do not do paid work and contribute to the project in our free time.

You can support us financially by donating: your contribution could be as little as buying us a glass of beer to as much as being enough to make you qualify as a sponsor.

We have defined the various donations levels at OpenMandriva as below (all figures in Euros):

- Bronze € 1,000 to € 4,999
- Silver € 5,000 to € 14,999
- Gold € 15,000 to € 49,999
- Platinum € 50,000 and over

So if you like OpenMandriva and appreciate our work, go ahead and show your love by donating through the button below.
If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please [contact us](mailto:council@openmandriva.org)

The donation can also be displayed on our wiki and on our landing page, if you wish.

If a donator agrees, we are glad to display the name on this page.
When you make a donation, please specify if you want your name to be open or not.
At the same time we always respect if you wish to stay anonymous, as many supporters do for their own reasons.
