Chwido is the name of one developer's dog, a little ratter. Being unofficial mascot of OpenMandriva, he is active in our forum and in our discussion rooms. Technically he is divided into two bots.

## Chwido in discussion rooms

Chwido is an IRC bot, but visible on both IRC channels and Matrix rooms. It is based on [Sopel](https://sopel.chat/docs/) and can use all its commands. It has also some additional commands.
