# Chat with OpenMandriva team

With any type of Chat or IRC people are in different time zones, or otherwise may not be available at the moment you post. You know, day jobs, family, health, or just life stuff. Please give us time to respond. We will reply as soon as someone is available. And be aware also that we are a small group.

The quickest way to get in touch with OpenMandriva is to join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#openmandriva-space:matrix.org)
