# Chat with OpenMandriva team

With any type of Chat or IRC people are in different time zones, or otherwise may not be available at the moment you post. You know, day jobs, family, health, or just life stuff. Please give us time to respond. We will reply as soon as someone is available. And be aware also that we are a small group.

The quickest way to get in touch with OpenMandriva is to join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#openmandriva-space:matrix.org)
<br />
### OpenMandriva newcomers welcome room
  - Matrix: `#openmandriva-hello:matrix.org`
  
This channel is for new users especially with problems installing or booting OMLx ROME or Rock.
<br />
### Generic OffTopic discussions
  - Matrix: `#openmandriva:matrix.org`
  - Telegram: https://t.me/openmandriva
  
While this channel is for off topic and general chat, and we by design don't censor any personal opinion, that does not mean it's not subject to common sense rules for everyone's enjoying to stay there. That means (but not exhaustive list) no unappropriate links or discussions which may hurt minors are admitted.
<br />
### Develoment (Cooker) discussions  
  - Matrix: `#openmandriva-cooker:matrix.org`
  - Telegram: https://t.me/openmandrivaCooker
  
This channel is for work and technical discussions with OM developers. Please respect that this is where OM developers work.

#### Note about Libera Chat
Due to factors not under the control of OpenMandriva ([1](https://libera.chat/news/temporarily-disabling-the-matrix-bridge), [2](https://libera.chat/news/matrix-bridge-disabled-retrospective)) the libera.chat bridge is not currently working. We are looking for a solution.
