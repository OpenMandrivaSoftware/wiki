# Cooker

## Welcome to OpenMandriva Cooker

Cooker is the development branch of OpenMandriva Lx. It reflects the current progress of work among all lines, and is considered a moving and unstable target.

## OpenMandriva technical overview
The OpenMandriva Lx distribution is made possible by two major fields of technical contribution: 
- creation and maintanance of the tools, configuration and art special to the distribution (like the installer, the configuration center, themes,..)
- consistent packaging of several thousand different programs and libraries in order to make them available to the user in a simple and consistent way
You are invited to help in both fields and will find the guidelines and rules at these pages. 

## Using Cooker
Advanced users feeling skilled enough to play and experiment with unstable releases, or developers for testing purpose, can download the latest cooker snapshot ISO files here:

- [znver1 iso](https://abf.openmandriva.org/platforms/cooker/products/53)

Please be aware that we cannot support systems on Cooker due to its nature.
