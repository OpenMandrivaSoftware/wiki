# OpenMandriva Quality Assurance

The goal of the Quality Assurance group is to ensure not only that bugs do not make their way to the public through testing and standards, but that they may be easily resolved through triaging to their respective packages and maintainers.

These are not meant to be perfect statements that dictate our work; rather, guiding principles that govern our work. We do not extensively test items like individual packages, as those are left up to the maintainers (though we do monitor every single update that goes through the system); rather, we make sure that the system as a whole functions properly. 

## Breakdown
- Cooperating with Cooker maintainers to assign bugs to those that may be able to resolve them.
- Providing for the testing repository and ensuring that migration to the stable repositories will not cause harm.
- Verifying the integrity of standards within the distribution releases.
- Coordinating and prioritizing major tasks that maintainers need to be aware of.
- Determining, with the help of Cooker maintainers, the release priorities and criteria that must be upheld for any release to happen.

## Joining QA
We welcome everyone to help us test OpenMandriva Lx.
You can see our [Getting Started](/dev/qa-getting-started) page for more information about the tools we have at our disposal, and future plans. 

## Policies
QA-Team members need a thorough understanding of:

- [Release Plan and Repositories](/doc/release-plan-and-repositories)
- [Repository Policies](/dev/repository-policies)
- [Current and Future Releases](/releases)

See also [OpenMandriva Release QA](/dev/release-qa)

## Tools
We use a variety of tools to help us with our work. However, none compare to the actual task of checking by hand and doing it with actual computers, as those are the true use cases.
We invite everyone to test any OpenMandriva official releases that occur, including development and milestone releases.

- [OpenMandriva Issue Tracker](http://issues.openmandriva.org/)
- [ABF](https://abf.openmandriva.org/projects)
- [Github](https://github.com/OpenMandrivaSoftware)
- [Kahinah](https://kahinah.rxu.tech/)
- Your Brain
- Your Computer/Computers

Please read: [How to report a bug](/doc/howto-report-bug)

## Communication
QA Team daily communication takes place on Freenode IRC channel #openmandriva-cooker, but remember that this is also where developers work so mind your IRC manners.
Currently OpenMandriva contributor group is small enough that developers and QA work together on IRC.
There is also a dedicated [QA Forum](https://forum.openmandriva.org/c/en/qa).

## Meetings
QA Team members are encouraged to actively attend weekly TC meetings or if unable to attend to read the [meeting logs](https://chwido.openmandriva.org/meetings/%23openmandriva-cooker/) to keep up with what is happening.
TC meetings are announced [here](https://forum.openmandriva.org/t/events-and-meetings-calendar/2735) and take place at #openmandriva-cooker.
