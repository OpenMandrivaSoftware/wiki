OpenMandriva Quality Assurance {#openmandriva_quality_assurance}
------------------------------

Welcome to the OpenMandriva Quality Assurance portal. As our association
grows, we strive to ensure that we uphold the standards of the
distribution as a whole.

The goal of the Quality Assurance group is to ensure not only that bugs
do not make their way to the public through testing and standards, but
that they may be easily resolved through triaging to their respective
packages and maintainers.

These are not meant to be perfect statements that dictate our work;
rather, guiding principles that govern our work. We do not extensively
test items like individual packages, as those are left up to the
maintainers (though we do monitor every single update that goes through
the system); rather, we make sure that **the system as a whole functions
properly**.

Breakdown
---------

-   Cooperating with Cooker maintainers to assign bugs to those that may
    be able to resolve them.
-   Providing for the testing repository and ensuring that migration to
    the stable repositories will not cause harm.
-   Verifying the integrity of standards within the distribution
    releases.
-   Coordinating and prioritizing major tasks that maintainers need to
    be aware of.
-   Determining, with the help of Cooker maintainers, the release
    priorities and criteria that must be upheld for any release to
    happen.

Policies
--------

QA-Team members need a thorough understanding of:

-   [Release Plan and Repositories]
-   [Repository Policies]
-   [Current and Future Releases (including Release Plans)]

*(There will be more as we better document our distro but we like to
keep documentation as simple and light as possible.)*

Tools
-----

We use a variety of tools to help us with our work. However, none
compare to the actual task of checking by hand and doing it with actual
computers, as those are the true use cases. We invite everyone to test
any OpenMandriva official releases that occur, including development and
milestone releases.

Communication
-------------

QA Team daily communication takes place on Freenode IRC channel
\#openmandriva-cooker but remember that this is also where developers
work so mind your IRC manners. Currently OpenMandriva contributor group
is small enough that developers and QA work together on IRC. There is
also a dedicated
