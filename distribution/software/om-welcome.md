# OpenMandriva Welcome

> Some bits of history:
> Since OpenMandriva Lx 2014, at the first boot of the system we will be greeted by OMA Welcome, a program aiming to disclose the distribution, its features, and to guide us - by mean of specific choices - on configuring the system and to install several programs and utilities.


Here is OM Welcome, the application created to show our distribution to the new users.
At every boot, until we will decide to disable it, we will be greeted by OM Welcome.

The first screen will introduce the distribution, our Community and the values on which it is based.

All screens are conveniently accessible by direct links in the top bar.

Here, near the 'Next' button, the user can disable OMA Welcome automatically starting at the system boot.

We will browse through the various screens of the program, each of them providing some different goals.

Click on <kbd>Next</kbd> to start

- Desktop Icons
- And a direct access to our main Configuration tool [OpenMandriva Control Center](/distribution/software/om-cc)
