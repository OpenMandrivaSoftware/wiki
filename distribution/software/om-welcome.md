<br>

*Some bits of history:
Since OpenMandriva Lx 2014, at the first boot of the system we will be greeted by OM Welcome, a program aiming to disclose the distribution, its features, and to guide us on configuring the system and to install several applications and utilities.*
<br>

At every boot, until we will decide to disable it, we will be greeted by OM Welcome.
<br>

### Welcome

The first screen will introduce the distribution, our Community and the values on which it is based.
All screens are conveniently accessible by direct links in the top bar.
Here, near to the bottom, the user can disable OMA Welcome automatically starting at the system boot.

We will browse through the various screens of the application, each of them providing some different goals.
