# OpenMandriva Lx 5.0 Release Notes

The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of **OpenMandriva Lx 5.0**.
<br>

## Available Media

This release is available as a live media USB flash drive (memory stick), downloadable in ISO format. These are available on our downloads page. USB flash drive installation is usually noticeably faster. As always speed depends on many factors. Live media means you are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a memory stick (see below) and try it before installing it. You may also install the system to hard disk either from the running live image or from the boot manager.

**Available ISO files:**
- *x86_64 KDE Plasma desktop* full featured (includes the most common used functionalities, multimedia and office software).
- *znver1 KDE Plasma desktop*: we have also built a version specifically for current AMD processors (Ryzen, ThreadRipper, EPYC) that outperforms the generic (x86_64) version by taking advantage of new features in those processors. znver1 is for the listed processors (Ryzen, ThreadRipper, EPYC)  only, do not install on any other hardware.

Installable images are offered for the Pinebook Pro, Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 3B+, Synquacer, Cubox Pulse and generic UEFI compatible devices (such as most aarch64 server boards)
<br>

## System requirements

OpenMandriva Lx 5.0 requires at least 2048 MB of memory and at least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with partitioning).

*Important Note: Graphics Hardware:*

The KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL 2.0 or above. We recommend using AMD, Intel, Adreno or VC4 graphics chips.
