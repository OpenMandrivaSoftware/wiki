# Which version should I download

Currently the most common hardware is 64 bits architectures PC — Intel / AMD — also know as x86\_64. 

Choosing another architecture certainly means that you already know what you are doing.

**ROME** is the rolling release designed for individual users. ROME will have more up to date packages including recent security and bug fix upgrades.
**Rock** is the stable release more suited for business, server, or those that do not like change. Rock releases get very few package upgrades during the life of each release.
