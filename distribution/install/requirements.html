<h1>Minimum configuration:</h1>
<p>OpenMandriva Lx goal is to take advantage of recent hardware, so you should not consider it as a solution for</p>
<p>If you plan to install OpenMandriva Lx on a regular PC, you need to be sure the processor is 64 bits (also reffered x86_64) as it won’t work on 32 bits only processors (also reffered as x586). If you have a doubt, know that Intel has stopped produced 32bits only processors in 2011, so you should consider any recent PC having a 64 bits processor.</p>
<p>You need at least 2GB memory for running Plasma Desktop environment (the default desktop environment from KDE) and most of standard applications (browser, word processing, music listening etc,). You should notice however that most games and even some websites may require much resources for working smoothly.</p>
<p>Please consider using SSD drive rather than classic mechanical drives for system (you can still use convert mechanical drives as an external disk with a dedicated device)</p>
<p>You need also 125 GB hard disk space for running OpenMandriva without having surprise in the future.</p>
<p>You can also install OpenMandriva over these hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pinephone</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>
<h1>Recommended configuration</h1>
<p>While Linux generally needs much less resources than Windows and MacOS X to work properly, other software may need the same amount whether they run on Linux or not.</p>
<p>So the easiest is to adapt the hardware you need following the requirements of the software you want to use.</p>
<p>Today (second half of 2021) we can consider to be comfortable with having at least 8 GB</p>
