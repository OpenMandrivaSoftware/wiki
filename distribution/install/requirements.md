If you plan to install OpenMandriva Lx on a regular PC, you need to be sure the processor is 64 bits (also reffered x86\_64) as it won’t work on 32 bits only processors (also reffered as x586). If you have a doubt, know that Intel has stopped produced 32bits only processors in 2011, so you should consider any recent PC having a 64 bits processor.

You need at least 2GB memory for running Plasma Desktop environment (the default desktop environment from KDE) and most of standard applications (browser, word processing, music listening etc,).
